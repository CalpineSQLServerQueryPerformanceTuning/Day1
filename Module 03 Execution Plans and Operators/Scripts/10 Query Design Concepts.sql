-- Rule #1: Operate on  Small Result Sets
--		Limit columns in select list
--		Use selective where clauses to limit rows


-- Rule #2: Avoid Nonsargable Search Conditions
--		Sargable means Search ARGument ABLE
--		Sargable = > < <= >= between like 'char%'
--		Non-Sargable <> != !> !< not in or like '%char'

-- Run both queries, notice Execution Plans look the same
-- But check out the IO stats, 7 Logical Reads vs 21 Logical Reads (4 Scans because in operator causes or statements)

-- Rule #3: Avoid Math on Columns in the Where Clause

-- Run both queries, notice Execution Plans and query costs are different
select *

where PurchaseOrderID * 2 = 3400;			-- Math is on column side, so does Index Scan

select *

-- Rule #4: Avoid Functions on Columns in the Where Clause
